This section contains materials on how to use the Phi_K correlation analysis code.
There are additional side notes on how certain aspects work and where to find parts of the code.
For more in depth explanations on the functionality of the code-base, try the `API docs <phik_index.html>`_.

All the tutorials are in ``notebooks`` directory. You can view them online too:

- `Basic tutorial <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/kaveio/phik/master/python/phik/notebooks/phik_tutorial_basic.ipynb>`_.
  Covers the basics of calculating Phi_K, the statistical significance, and interpreting the correlation.
- `Advanced tutorial <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/kaveio/phik/master/python/phik/notebooks/phik_tutorial_advanced.ipynb>`_.
  The advanced tutorial shows how to use the advanced features of the ``PhiK`` library.
